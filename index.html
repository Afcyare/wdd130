            Hi! My name is Farhan Abdi. Iâ€™m originally from Somalia, 
            and I currently live in Uganda. Iâ€™m passionate about technology 
            and have recently enrolled in the Software Development program at BYU-Idaho. I enjoy coding, 
            especially building websites that are both functional and visually appealing. 
            Iâ€™m always eager to learn new programming skills and stay up to date with the latest web development trends. 
            My goal is to become a professional software developer and use my skills to solve real-world problems 
            and create positive change in my community and beyond.
        </p>
