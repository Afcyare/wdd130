            Hi! My name is Farhan Abdi. Iâ€™m originally from Somalia, 
            and I currently live in Uganda. Iâ€™m passionate about technology 
            and have recently enrolled in the Software Development program at BYU-Idaho. I enjoy coding, 
            especially building websites that are both functional and visually appealing. 
            Iâ€™m always eager to learn new programming skills and stay up to date with the latest web development trends. 
            My goal is to become a professional software developer and use my skills to solve real-world problems 
            and create positive change in my community and beyond.
        </p>

        <p>
            Somalia is a country located in the Horn of Africa, bordered by Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti, with a long coastline along the Indian Ocean. 
            It has a rich cultural heritage rooted in Islam, traditional clan structures, and a history of trade and seafaring. 
            Despite facing challenges such as political instability and drought, Somalia is known for its resilient people, vibrant oral poetry, 
            and strong sense of community. 
            The capital city is Mogadishu, and Somali is the official language. 
            Somalia continues to work toward rebuilding its institutions and economy while preserving its deep cultural traditions.
